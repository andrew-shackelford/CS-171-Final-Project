Now a joke isn't funny if you have to explain it, but so many people have been expressing their incredulity at it that I feel compelled to defend it (and hopefully clear myself of the charges of witlessness). I always thought it was a very unique kind of joke; I haven't heard any quite like it.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think the question itself is funny. Why? Because it *just* fails to make sense at the last moment. Any way you attempt to parse it you get thrown for a loop. I guess it's a matter of taste whether you enjoy that or not.\r\n\r\nThe first answer continues in that vein with the same singular/plural confusion: It would make sense if it was \"One of its legs is the same as...\" or \"Both of its legs are the same.\" Pieces of it make sense but not the whole put together; I think it's something like a linguistic equivalent of the Penrose triangle. Actually, I think it *is* the equivalent, because that's exactly the same sense of amusement I get.\r\n\r\nThe second answer is the same, but additionally you can have fun trying to visualize the ludicrous image of a duck banging its head together when it walks.\r\n\r\nThe last one is just funny because it's absurd. I can't explain, just try to imagine acting it out to somebody.\r\n\r\nBy now, apart from thinking the joke is unfunny, you're also thinking what a loser this guy is trying to explain a bad joke and making a fool of himself in the process, so I'll just shut up now. But not before telling you the one about... *(Edit: Bah, it's been [posted already](http://reddit.com/info/6xmp/comments#c707v).)* ...the Buddhist who walks up to a hot dog vendor and says, \"Make me one with everything.\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOh, and when the guy hands him a hot dog, the Buddhist pays him and asks for his change.

Maybe the landlord can recoup the cost of mortgage payments and taxes and insurance and repairs each month, but maybe not.  In fact, if you consider the fact that two different landlords in identical buildings could be paying drastically different amounts on their mortgages, there's no reason to assume that PITI == rent.  Maybe the property is cashflow positive, maybe it's negative.\r\n\r\nSome landlords assuredly have negative cash flow on their property.  In these cases, the renters are *not* paying for repairs.\r\n\r\nThere's all sorts of reasons landlords find themselves in a position where they have to rent at a loss.  Most of them have to do with the state of the rental market -- if the market won't pay enough to cover costs, well, tough cookies.  Leaving it vacant doesn't really decrease the cost of maintaining the property that much, so they might as well rent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you consider the fluctuations of the rental markets from year to year, it's even easier to poke holes in the PITI == rent equation.\r\n\r\nAll this said, I found the article's analysis to be too simplistic.

A knife impales organs, punctures lungs, cuts arteries, and causes major blood loss.  It also concentrates force -- punch someone in the ribs hard and cause a bruise; use the same amount of force with a knife and you probably break the bone.\r\n\r\nDan Inosanto (Bruce Lee's buddy) did a lot of training with police officers and made training tapes.  They found that if you have a holstered gun, someone with a knife within 15 feet can probably close and stab you, possibly to death, even if you manage to eventually shoot him.  He has a good chance to grapple with you and prevent you from even drawing your gun, being that he can cut you as you both struggle.\r\n\r\nI know movies always show superficial line cuts from knives but in reality getting stabbed is an effective way to die.

That means you have no anti-virus and no firewall.  Nothing.  Of course, it was a Beta product I was using, but it automatically upgrades itself each time MS fixes bugs, and 3 weeks ago, it was the \"final\" product... \r\n\r\nAs I said, I had it on 3 PCs, and last month, 2 OneCare installations completely crapped out--so much so that their support people told me to uninstall &amp; reinstall (online, of course, meaning I was connecting to the web completely unprotected), edit the registry, run a few MS uninstaller products, etc.  That was a pain in the ass, but the support instructions were even worse, and the follow-up was literally non-existent.\r\n\r\nTech Support is not available 24x7, so if you have a problem at night or on a weekend, you're screwed.  Worse still, the instructions they gave me were useless; I had to figure it out myself.  Even after I wrote to 4 different MS support units, I never got a response, until I posted a message on a MS board, detailing their horrible customer service for Beta testers.  And to add insult to injury, the new instructions they gave me were impossible to complete, since the old instructions messed up my registry, which disallowed a fresh installation of OneCare!\r\n\r\nAnyway, for the casual PC user who doesn't want to bother with security, OneCare is fine.  But for anyone who actually uses his/her PC regularly, avoid OneCare &amp; use separate security products.  \r\n\r\nAfter finally getting OneCare off my PCs, I opted for NOD32 antivirus and Kerio firewall, and they're a breath of fresh air.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473824741,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"c70uy","parent_id":"t3_6z8l","author_flair_text":null,"author":"sjw"},

While there are obviously some Christians that do hate, I don't believe that saying homosexuality is wrong is hate speech. You can dislike what someone does and not hate them. Sometimes I really dislike what my friends do to me, but I never hate them.\r\n\r\nBut if he's talking about the \"God hates fags\" stuff, then yeah, that's hate speech.\r\n\r\n&gt; They wonder why, for example, fundamentalist Christians so seldom quote from the New Testament--which is supposedly what Christianity is all about--but prefer citing the Torah and Old Testament prophets.\r\n\r\nThey are legalists, Pharisees. They existed in Christ's day and they exist now, and it really shouldn't be suprising. Man has used everything possible to exert their control over other human beings, whether it be money, power, politics, and religion is another great way of doing it.\r\n\r\nBut Christ got pretty hardcore about those people. They were really the only group he completely lashed out at.\r\n\r\n*\"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.* - Matthew 23\r\n\r\nThey forget what is important:\r\n\r\n*\"Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\"* - Matthew 23:10\r\n\r\n&gt; One reason is that the Old Testament is full of murder, vindictiveness, and genocide--all supposedly ordered by God. So when fundamentalists want a Biblical excuse for hate speech and hate crimes--which they seem to need with considerable frequency--they turn to Old Testament sources.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with that is while the OT is full of murder, vindictiveness, and genocide, much of it is recorded, but much of it isn't approved of by God. One thing that shows to me that the Bible is a realistic book is that it never tries to whitewash the Jews' history. David, Israel's most celebrated king, slept with a woman and then had her husband murdered. Now the Bible was clear that God was very upset with that, but instead of omitting that from the record and trying to act like it never happened, the Jews recorded it and wrote about God's reaction to it, because in the end the Bible is still a story about God and his interactions with man, including the good and bad of man.\r\n\r\n&gt; Christian homophobes, for example, carry signs saying 'God hates fags', which they justify by claiming that Leviticus 18:22 (condemning male homosexuality as \"abomination\") is the 'word of God'. Yet more than a third of the entire book of Leviticus is devoted to God's detailed instructions on the proper manner of making burnt offerings of animals to Him. (The rest deals with keeping Jewish dietary laws, avoiding pollution from inadvertent contact with menstruating women, forbidding haircuts and beard trimming, justifying slavery, and saying anyone who swears should be stoned to death). Why doesn't God hate those who fail to make offerings in the exact manner He so carefully spelled out in chapter after chapter? Since fundamentalists feel comfortable ignoring 95% of the 'word of God' in Leviticus, why have they latched onto this isolated phrase? If \"God hates fags\", then God must feel positively murderous toward people who don't make burnt offerings of animal carcasses in the precise manner so carefully indicated, and in such extreme detail. (God must also hate people who eat lobster, shrimp and pork, which are also \"abominations\" according to Leviticus).\r\n\r\nThe \"God hates\" fags stuff sickens me, but the mention of homosexuality being a sin is repeated in the New Testament in Romans 1 (it may be 2).\r\n\r\n&gt; It's startling, in fact, how rarely fundamentalist Christians mention the sayings of Jesus. 'Morality' to them means the sexual inhibitions of ancient Middle Eastern patriarchies. They seem to be nostalgic for the pruderies of the 1950s, when the Hays office decreed that movies couldn't show pajama-clad married couples in bed together lest it incite teenage moviegoers to fornication. This obsession with sexuality is surprising, since Jesus seemed to have very little interest in the topic. In the four Gospels there are only four statements about sexuality, and these deal with adultery and divorce rather than sex per se. That is, with relationships--with causing injury to another.\r\n\r\nChrist made the statement, \"I tell you the truth, if you look at a woman lustfully you have committed adultery with her in your heart.\"\r\n\r\nIt would thus lead one to believe that anything more than that (fooling around, looking at porn, etc) would also be seen as adultery.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there isn't anything wrong with sex itself, and Christians that try to restrict it even among married couples are nuts.\r\n\r\n&gt; for these texts were written in societies that were misogynistic, militaristic, and rigidly authoritarian--written, furthermore, by men who believed the earth was flat.\r\n\r\nYes, the OT is very militaristic and authoritarian because Israel was developing as a nation and needed stringent laws, otherwise they would end up like the nations around them, sacrificing their children to pieces of stone (which they did end up doing, unfortunately). This is also why Christ comes along and says that while he has not abolished the law, he has fulfilled it. The laws that applied to a theocratic Israel don't apply to Christians as a whole now in many cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, the OT is also a beautiful book of laments, wisdom, and remorse, which I find that many people often overlook. I think some of the most fascinating things are passages such as Psalm 22 which literally detail the entire crucifixion scene 1,000 years before it happened.\r\n\r\nBut they believed the earth was flat? I believe it is Psalm 40:22 which says, \"God sits above the circle of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n&gt; The reason why so many fundamentalist Christians are so notoriously \"unChristian\" is simple: for the majority of Christians (Quakers are among many notable exceptions) Christianity isn't about the teachings of Jesus, and never was. \r\n\r\nBingo.\r\n\r\n&gt; The early church fathers knew that Jesus' rather Buddhist message of nonviolence and voluntary poverty wouldn't fly in the Graeco-Roman world, let alone in the Middle East. The idea of a Redeemer on the other hand--someone who would voluntarily sacrifice Himself for humanity and their sins--was very popular. Instead of having to give up their worldly goods and espouse non-violence, all the Romans had to do was believe in the miraculous stories surrounding Jesus' birth and death, which was easy for them, since such stories had been told about pagan gods and heroes and were already familiar.\r\n\r\nIf this was true the church would have never spread as it did before Constantine came to power, while it was still heavily persecuted.\r\n\r\nJesus was also a very \"un-Roman\" god. Christ the Jewish man dying naked on a cross crapping all over himself isn't nearly as appealing as Jupiter.\r\n\r\n&gt; Christianity as it exists among fundamentalists isn't about behaving like Jesus. It's all about faith--about believing the story. The underlying message seems to be: you can behave any way you want as long as you believe the story and say you're sorry before you die. Following the teachings of Jesus is much too demanding, whereas with the Christianity of fundamentalists all you have to do is shut your mind off.\r\n\r\nWhich is why James says, \"Faith without works is dead.\"\r\n\r\n&gt; There ought to be a term that would designate those who actually follow the teachings of Jesus, since the word \"Christian\" has been largely divorced from those teachings, and so polluted by fundamentalists that it has come to connote their polar opposite: intolerance, vindictive hatred, and bigotry.\r\n\r\n\"Christian\" is the word. Christian literally means \"little Christ.\" If people don't act like Christ, they can't be a \"little Christ\" aka Christian.\r\n\r\nIf all I did was write HTML, I could call myself a programmer, but that doesn't make me one. Its my actions which give me a title.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post, but you guys know I like discussing this.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_70sm","stickied":false},

If you are not allowed to presume home appreciation, you shouldn't be able to presume such exceptional investment returns.  6% after tax is realistic, but still aggressive.  If you live in a country without mortgage interest tax deduction, it's comparable to interest payments.\r\n\r\nSo you can compare home ownership to investment ownership without complicating mortgage costs... compare owning outright.\r\n\r\nThe cost of home ownership are property taxes, insurance maintenance, and RE commission on sale.  Tax and insurance adds up to 1.1% of value on my property.  Maintenance tends not to vary so much with home value, but lets just make it 0.4% anyway.  1.5% total.  Hope for 5% appreciation to cover 5% RE commission.\r\n\r\nBy my calculation, $7500/yr in rent is equivalent to owning $100000 of home, if you presume no home appreciation.  This is approximately the comparative rent levels in my area.\r\n\r\nIf instead of presuming 6% aftertax investment return, you presume just 4% higher investment returns than home appreciation (after RE commmission) which is actually the historical rates, then $5500/yr ~$460/mo per $100,000 home value.\r\n\r\nSo it boils down to expected returns from alternative investments, deducting 1.5% from home ownership.\r\n\r\nYou can get 5% from US government bonds.\r\nIf you think there is a housing bubble, don't buy.  If there is going to be a soft landing on housing, with just slow price hikes from here, then its a bit better to own home.","controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_704x","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473824746,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"Godspiral","edited":false,"id":"c715u","parent_id":"t3_704x"},

That\u2019s your right. But the second you try and restrict a man or woman\u2019s right to marry another man or woman, you\u2019ve crossed the line.\r\n\r\nI personally don't think I'll ever have any political issues with homosexuals getting married (I'm not much of a political person anyway). The only problem I have there is homosexuals adopting kids.\r\n\r\nThere's just not enough conclusive evidence (considering how recently homosexuality in this nation has been embraced) to show what the psychological effects are on a kid raised by a homosexual couple.\r\n\r\nBut hey, if homosexuals want to get married, let them get married. They exist in society anyway, I don't think its gonna make much of a difference if they have a slightly different legal status.\r\n\r\n&gt; Believe that all abortion is wrong. That\u2019s your right. But the second you try and restrict a woman\u2019s right to extract a cell cluster that exhibits NO brain function from her body, you\u2019ve crossed the line.\r\n\r\nThis is the main thing I'll disagree with you about and one of the few things I will actively campaign against.\r\n\r\nI don't care if fetuses don't always have brain function, they will at one time become living human beings (given the natural course of things). If a woman does not want to get pregnant, she quite simply should not be taking an action which naturally leads to that. She needs to be ready to rais e the child or at least carry it to term and put it up for adoption.\r\n\r\nIts called responsibility, and I think it is absolutely wrong to kill off what will be (or is) human life simply because it isn't convenient at the time. If it wasn't conventient, you shouldn't have done things which might inconvenience you.\r\n\r\nAs I've stated before on this site, in cases of rape, incest, or the possible death of the mother, I feel that the boundaries are stretched a bit more.\r\n\r\nBut I still believe it is wrong and will actively fight against convenience abortions.\r\n\r\n&gt; Believe that drugs are bad. That\u2019s your right. Don\u2019t do them. But the second you try and tell me what I can and cannot put in my body, you\u2019ve crossed the line.\r\n\r\nAnd you've crossed the line if in doing those drugs you've put yourself into a state that is a danger to me, my family, or my friends (eh, I think you pretty much said this).\r\n\r\nI don't think a society full of pot heads and coke addicts benefits anyone, though.\r\n\r\n&gt; You will note that every one of these is a victimless crime. And that\u2019s the point\u2026 Live and let live, as long as you don\u2019t harm someone else.\r\n\r\nThere is not such thing as a \"victimless\" crime. The kid that has emotional issues because they were raised by two men is a victim. The baby that was never born because its mommy had sex and then didn't want to raise it is a victim. The kid neglected because its father is a coke addict is a victim.\r\n\r\nObviously these are negative instances while these situations aren't always negative - however there are some actions which have a higher-rate of producing negative instances. But \"live and let live\" can never work because what some people are hurt by is what others consider a normal life.\r\n\r\nFinding that balance is hard; we don't want to live in a legalistic restrictive society, but we also don't want to live in a wide-open one which causes more problems than it solves.\r\n\r\nEverything has some kind of effect, even if it is extremely minute. These are things that we have an extremely hard time determining. Will legalizing weed be detrimental to our society? Obviously it will negatively affect somebody, but even the best things in life cause problems sometimes. So what is truly good and what is truly bad?\r\n\r\nThat's one of the reasons that I think without an absolute truth, an absolute right/wrong, and a God, you run into all kinds of difficulties. I can't think of anything bad that could possibly happen to the person who truly followed all of Christ's commands. They'd probably be one the most content people in the world.","link_id":"t3_70sm","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1149174656,"score":0,"ups":0},

Kansas City Hyatt walkways, 1981\r\nWalkways crisscrossing the hotel\u2019s multistory atrium collapsed, domino-style, raining debris and hundreds of people onto the packed dance contest below. The cause: grossly negligent design and use of beams that could support only 30 percent of the load.\r\n\r\nThe description on Wired.com is not very accurate.  There's a detailed explanantion in Mario Salvadori's book *Why Buildings Fall Down*.  Salvadori's explanation, which I summarize below, is corroborated by [this description from the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Utah](http://www.mech.utah.edu/ergo/educate/safety_modules/KC/) .\r\n\r\nThe design was to have vertical hangers from the ceiling that could support the design load.  The hangers would be threaded, and each one  would have a nut in the middle and a nut at the bottom.  The middle nuts would support the upper walkway on the hanger and the lower nuts would support the lower walkway on the hanger.\r\n\r\nWhen time came to do the implementation, the contractors couldn't figure out how to put a thread onto the middle of a fifty-foot-long hanger and get a nut onto it.  So they asked the structural engineer if they could cut the hanger in two, put a nut at the bottom of the top half of the hanger to support the upper walkway, then hang the lower half of the hanger from the upper walkway and put a nut on the lower part of the hanger to support the lower walkway.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this design is that the upper nut is now supporting both walkways instead of only the upper one.  When people on the walkway were dancing and stomping to a band in the lobby below, one of these nuts gave way, leading to a progressive failure of the rest of the nuts, and both walkways fell into the lobby.\r\n\r\nThe negligence trial focused on the crucial question of whether the structural engineers had approved the changes to the hanger design.    The trial found that they had.\r\n\r\n114 people died, and 200 more were injured.\r\n\r\n"},

This is an irrational fear, and though you are welcome to have this fear\u2026 don\u2019t make laws restricting freedom based on it.\r\n\r\n&gt; As far as psychological effects go, evidence of that is very hard to collect one way or another.\r\n\r\nAbuse isn't my concern, its the psychological effects, but as you've said, those are hard to determine regardless.\r\n\r\nI have a very hard time thinking that a kid raised by homosexual parents won't be affected in some way when the status-quo for as long as recorded history goes has never been homosexual couples raising children. Even in Rome and such where they openly practiced homosexuality, children still were never raised by same-sex couples.\r\n\r\n&gt; Unfortunately, potential for life is not life. We have a legal definition of death. That is, when brain activity ceases. Why then, is the opposite not the definition of the beginning of life?

When you've eradicated those, *then* let's look at the effect of same-sex parents.\r\n\r\n&gt;As I've stated before on this site, in cases of rape, incest, or the possible death of the mother, I feel that the boundaries are stretched a bit more.\r\n\r\nOoo, 'a bit more'.

It's what's repulsive about black-and-white thinking.  Somehow, just because *some* people hurt others as a side effect of victimless activities (for most), therefore *all* people who engage in those activities are bad. Nice work.\r\n\r\n&gt;even the best things in life cause problems sometimes.

For example, Moyers hints that there is some anti-Semitism involved.  However, there are Christian groups that could be considered very much pro-Semetic.  They might be in the rapture camp, but they also believe that all of Israel will make it through the 'tribulation' (though, admitedly, it's a bit tougher for them than it is for the Christians even in this view).  Back to the point: It's easy in American Evangelicalism to splinter off into a new group.  The split is often over some subtle difference in interpretting the book of Revelation.\r\n2) Some Christian groups (lets call them \"Post Evangelicals\" - I consider myself one) are rejecting this interpretation of the book of Revelation.  The current Evangelical meta-narrative (the one that Moyers is referring too) just seems a bit too convenient: The 'true' Christians get rescued (raptured) from the earth just before all the bad stuff goes down.  It just seems a bit too _convenient_.  Also, the \"right-wingers\" (for lack of a better term) seem to be reading Revelation very selectively, such as ignoring the place in Chapter 12 (or is it 11?) where it says \"_the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth_\".\r\n3) (and Moyers makes the point very well) The rapture meta-narrative has led large groups of Christians to disregard the future.  \"No need to care for the environment because it's all gonna burn!\" is often the attitude; sort of a religiously sanctioned scorched earth policy ;-)\r\n\r\nThere are other interpretations of Christian eschatology emerging.  Or maybe it would be better to say, that some Christians are investigating earlier interpretations that were prevelant before the current meta-narrative took hold in the late 1800s.  It's interesting to note that prior to that the current \"Left Behind\" view was considered heretical.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_6zsl","subreddit_id":"t5_6"},

With the NT, Paul says that homosexuality is wrong. As he was living in Greece or Italy at the time, he would've been surrounded by a culture in which homosexuality was more openly practiced (even by married men) than ours.\r\n\r\nAs such, I believe that homosexuality is a sin. However, in the same breath (figuratively speaking), Paul condemns extra- and pre-marital sex. I also believe these are sins but every one of my friends has partaken of these sins and I have, so far, managed to avoid stoning them (and even manage to /talk/ to them every so often!).\r\n\r\nThe reason I have stayed my hand is that, according to the NT, all sins are equal. That means that me looking at pornography (which, of course, I never do...) is exactly as damning as my friends having sex outside of marriage which is, in turn, exactly as damning as killing someone. They all remove me from God's presence to an equal amount, once I die.

The idea of a Redeemer on the other hand--someone who would voluntarily sacrifice Himself for humanity and their sins--was very popular. Instead of having to give up their worldly goods and espouse non-violence, all the Romans had to do was believe in the miraculous stories surrounding Jesus' birth and death, which was easy for them, since such stories had been told about pagan gods and heroes and were already familiar.\"\r\n\r\nThis isn't true. For all its problems, the Catholic church always preached both good behaviour and faith in the resurrection story as necessary for salvation. It was only with the reformation that the idea of \"faith alone\" became popular, and only with the hardline evangelical churches that it became the only focus.\r\n\r\nI'm a lapsed catholic, so I don't really care too much, but I do think that baptists and other evangelicals give catholics and normal protestants a bad name.

{"body":"Well, at least he's honest about it.\r\n\r\nI doubt that these CEOs act out of greed so much as fear that if they don't, somebody else *will*.  That's the whole issue with China: you refuse to go along with their censorship policies, and they just say \"Sorry, goodbye\" and let Baidu have the whole market.  Your defiance doesn't gain anything for the Chinese people, it just cuts you off from the market.\r\n\r\nIt's a really tricky balancing act to know when you have the power to effect real change and when it's better to conserve your political capital and back off.  A lot of executives are, ironically enough, not arrogant *enough* because they've seen what happens to CEOs who do they take the plunge but misjudge their position.  So they play it safe, pursue profits (something they know how to do), and don't stick their necks out.\r\n\r\nAnd when a leader does stick his neck out and turns out to be wrong (like George W. Bush on Iraq), he's universally pilloried.  I join in the pillorying, because I think Bush ignored evidence that was staring him in the face that Iraq would be another Vietnam and not another World War 2.  But I also don't think Terry Semel has enough power to take on the Chinese government and win.  I dunno; I certainly *like* Google's approach better.

Another way of saying this is that men should be permitted to live in such a way that they are not disturbed by their fellow men, and government should enforce this and nothing else, taking the funds it needs to do this from the governed.  By definition, government affects everyone within a certain area, and the people in that area are not allowed to \"opt out\", so for that reason I believe it should be as small as possible.  There are many things that the government does that I believe could be done more effectively outside of government, without forcing everyone to participate in them.  So really what a lot of this debate comes down to is  a) are government programs neccesary and effective and b) could the tasks assigned to said programs be done just as well or better outside government.  Liberals tend to think, for example, that the state of poverty would be considerably worse without welfare, whereas libertarians often express opinions that welfare encourages poverty.  Obviously, the reason the liberal position is more popular is that it sounds a lot more plausible that proving welfare for poor people will help their situation than hurt their situation.","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1149204129,"subreddit":"reddit.com"},

The problem, as you mention, is when your morals are bad.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you are accustomed to thinking of christianity as a bad thing, I recommend reading C.S. Lewis's book *Mere Christianity*.  My mother seems to me a devout christian but she doesn't go around condemning people.  I asked her what she thought of gays and she didn't voice any negative opinions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Christian worldview, we are all sinners who fall short of the glory of God.  What Christianity preaches is that we should first of all realize that we are sinners and repent of our sins, then work on becoming better people.  So although some Christians may regard homosexuality as a sin, there's no particular reason it should deserve more attention than, say, theft.  Christians are called not condemn others so much as show them by our behaviour that they too can have a relationship with God.  That's why it bothers me so much when Christians try to enforce thier idea of what's right on other people.

These things only exist in a social context, which essentially takes you out of your 'state of nature' and into the world of negotiated relations.   Unfortunately, we do have a tendency to disturb our fellow men: we are the *zoon politikon*, and government is mother's milk to us.\r\n\r\nThere might, for example, be disagreement as to what constitutes disturbance. The US Constitution specifically authorizes it, when necessary. Can immoral acts (even if consensual) be disturbances to society at large?  And having admitted that what we have is a society, jointly governed, should there not be some debate on its nature?\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be an American, for example?  People seem to have a clear idea about what's anti-American, but I haven't heard so much about the other.  Should it presuppose a certain level of education, worldliness, affluence? Are these things worth aspiring to *as a society*?  What should we do if they are?\r\n\r\nMy view is that some things work more efficiently when state-owned, or at least operated under public supervision.  These tend to be the things that are basic for a functioning society, and that often don't break up very easily into viable companies that will genuinely compete with one another.  Large scale public transport networks (rail, for example), power supply, education &amp; health.\r\n\r\nNot, indeed, that I would compel anyone to send their children to a state school, or force anyone into a public hospital if they were ill, but everyone would pay taxes to ensure that both were available, and first-rate, if needed.\r\n\r\nThe logic is simple -- it is to the benefit of society at large to have a well-educated and healthy population.  If people want to opt out, they can have religious schools and private hospitals, but these have to conform to democratically agreed standards of what constitutes education (outside the religious sphere) and health-care (no Galenic medicine).\r\n\r\nI am not American, but have visited that fair country many times, and seen the amount of worry and privation that middle-class American families endure to give their kids the education they need to maintain their social status and have some chance of a good life.  University fees are completely ludicrous.  \r\n\r\nObviously it is undesirable to have people on welfare, but the only solution to that is to educate them to be able to take their place in the world.  Enrich their lives, and they will manage to enrich themselves.  In the meantime, as members of your society, they will have the rights of a full citizen, to health-care and basic support.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that there is flagrant waste and abuse at every level of the system, but the crucial difference between public and private is that we have the ability and the duty to scrutinize public bodies, and to hold people accountable.  We live in democracies, and can change the rules, and the management, whenever we want.   \r\n\r\nWe may need a new kind of politics, we don't need the apolitical leave-me-alone school of social atomism.","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473824770,"gilded":0,"id":"c72gi","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c72eu","author_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]"},
